 - [Express.JS]() - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
 - [GraphQL]() - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries
 - [Apollo Serevr]() - Apollo Server is the best way to quickly build a production-ready, self-documenting API for GraphQL clients, using data from any source.
